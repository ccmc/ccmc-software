Overview
========
Kameleon is a software suite that is being developed at the CCMC to address the difficulty in analyzing and disseminating the varying output formats of space weather model data. Through the employment of a comprehensive data format standardization methodology, Kameleon allows heterogeneous model output to be stored uniformly in a common science data format. The converted files contain both the original model output as well as additional metadata elements to create platform independent and self-descriptive data files. To facilitate model data dissemination, data reuse, and code reuse â€“ the Kameleon access and interpolation library provides direct access to both the model data as well as the embedded metadata.

In a nutshell, the Kameleon converter reads model output data and re-writes the data into a standard format. The Kameleon access/interpolation library reads data already converted by Kameleon providing a high level interface to the data.

Features
--------

- Model Readers and Interpolators for models hosted at the CCMC. For a list of supported models, see :ref:`Supported-Models`.  
- Model-specific field line integration
- Wrappers for C, Fortran, Python, and Java


Coming Soon
-----------
- Model plug-ins: Python-embedded readers and interpolators
- Support for Rice Convection Model
- Separatrix Analysis
- New SWMF Ionospheric interpolator
- Python Visualization tools
- ParaView and MayaVi support
- Dimensional analysis for Unit conversions and derived variables
- Simplicial Complex analysis on top of CGAL


Installation
------------

See :ref:`Quick_start` for cross-platform installation.
    
Tutorials
---------

The new :ref:`Coordinate_Transformations` tutorial illustrates coordinate-aware interpolation. Users may choose from a set of standard Heilospheric or Magnetospheric coordinate systems. Kameleon will automatically transform interpolation positions to the coordinate system of the underlying model.

The new :ref:`_grid_tutorial` illustrates usage of the command-line tool grid.py, which interpolates variables onto a user-specified grid.
